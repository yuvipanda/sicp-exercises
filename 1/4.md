The procedure under consideration is:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

As the name suggests, it adds a to the absolute value of b. It is accomplished by doing an addition if b is positive or a subtraction if b is negative (thus cancelling out -ve in b).

We can think of the `if` as returning the operator that will be applied to a and b. This implies we can extend it to anything - the operator to be applied can be determined by any arbitrarily complex procedure.

Also, die Java! :)
