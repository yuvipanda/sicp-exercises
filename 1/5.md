The program under consideration is:
(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
        0
        y))
(test 0 (p))

We note that procedure `p` is an infinitely recursive procedure that does not terminate at all. So, if the program is to successfully terminate, `p` must never be evaluated.

"Expand and Reduce" is normal order evaluation, while "evaluate and apply" is applicative order.

So, in an interpreter using Normal Order Evaluation, the (p) is first expanded in the call to test. This is a non-terminating infinite loop, so the interpreter will never be able to complete that expansion - and hence will be stuck there till the end of time. Duke Nukem forever will release before it ends. It is, afterall, an *infinite* loop.

In an interpreter using Applicative Order Evaluation, `y` in the if is replaced with (p), and the test is first performed. Since the test evaluates to true, 0 is returned and (p) is never evaluated, thus saving the Universe. No infinite loop.

TL;DR: Normal Order Evaluation results in infinite loop, Applicative Order Evaluation does not
