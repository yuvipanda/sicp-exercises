The first one is recursive because the `+` call 'captures' current value of b, and hence the interpreter has to maintain that. The second one is not, since the `+` call is provided computed values which can be discarded after being passed to it.

Expanding first `(+ 4 5)`,

    (+ 4 5)
    (inc (+ 3 5))
    (inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
    (inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
    (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5))))
    (inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
    (inc (inc (inc 6)))
    (inc (inc 7))
    (inc 8)
    (9)

Expanding second `(+ 4 5)`
    
    (+ 4 5)
    (+ 3 6)
    (+ 2 7)
    (+ 1 8)
    (+ 0 9)
    (9)

As can be seen from the shape, the first one is indeed recursive, while the second one isn't.
