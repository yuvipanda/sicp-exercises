Because it would evaluate the else clause anyway - since the new-if is not a special form (or a macro), it's arguments would be evaluated before being passed in. Besides being ineffecient, bad things can happen if the else clause has side effects.

Note that by `else clause` I refer to the clause that should not have been evaluated if the proper behavior was maintained.
