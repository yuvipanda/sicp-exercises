Ackerman function is:

    (define (A x y)
      (cond ((= y 0) 0)
            ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
            ((= y 1) 2)
            (else (A (- x 1)
                     (A x (- y 1))))))

Value of `(A 1 10)` is 1024

Value of `(A 2 4)` is 65536

Value of `(A 3 3)` is also 65536

(Above values produced by simply executing them in `mit-scheme`)

Now to find values of curried functions of A, let's first define A mathematically

    A = 0   if y = 0
        2   if y = 1
        2y  if x = 0
        A(x-1, A(x, y-1)) otherwise

Now to find,

`(define (f n) (A 0 n))`

x = 0, hence `f(n) = 2n`

`(define (g n) (A 1 n))`

g(n)    = A(0, A(1, n-1))
        = 2 * A(1, n-1)
        = 2 * A(0, A(1, n-2))
        = 2 * 2 * A(1, n-3)
        = 2^n

`(define (h n) (A 2 n))`

h(n)    = A(1, A(2, n-1))
        = A(0, A(1, A(2, n-1) - 1 ))
        = 2 * A(1, A(2, n-1) - 1 )
        = 2 * 2 ^ (A(2, n-1) - 1)
        = 2 ^ (A(2, n-1))
        = 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ... n times 

Damn, that was quite beautiful :)

Now I *need* to derive `(A 3 n)`, just to satisfy myself.

m(n)    = A(2, A(3, n-1))
        = 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ... A(3, n-1) times
        = 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ... 

I give up.. It intuitively makes sense to me that it go up 'one more level', but I seem to lack the basic mathematical understanding required to properly put it out. Oh well. Maybe that's why it wasn't part of the exercise :)
